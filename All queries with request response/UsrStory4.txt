1) Create City
	CREATE (München : City {name:'München'})
	CREATE (Heidelberg : City {name:'Heidelberg'})
	CREATE (Mannheim : City {name:'Mannheim'})
	CREATE (Heilbronn : City {name:'Heilbronn'})
	CREATE (Frankfurt : City {name:'Frankfurt'})
	CREATE (Ludwigshafen : City {name:'Ludwigshafen'})

2) Create Relation between cities with distance between cities as property. CONNECTED {distance : 50}
	
	MATCH (city1:City)
	WITH city1
	MATCH (city2:City)
	WHERE city1.name = "Heidelberg" AND city2.name = "Ludwigshafen"
	CREATE (city1)-[relation:CONNECTED{distanceInKilometers : 22, averageTimeInMinutes : 40}]->(city2)
	
	MATCH (city1:City)
	WITH city1
	MATCH (city2:City)
	WHERE city1.name = "Heidelberg" AND city2.name = "Mannheim"
	CREATE (city1)-[relation:CONNECTED{distanceInKilometers : 20, averageTimeInMinutes : 30}]->(city2)	
	
	MATCH (city1:City)
	WITH city1
	MATCH (city2:City)
	WHERE city1.name = "Heidelberg" AND city2.name = "Heilbronn"
	CREATE (city1)-[relation:CONNECTED{distanceInKilometers : 70, averageTimeInMinutes : 45}]->(city2)

	MATCH (city1:City)
	WITH city1
	MATCH (city2:City)
	WHERE city1.name = "Heidelberg" AND city2.name = "Frankfurt"
	CREATE (city1)-[relation:CONNECTED{distanceInKilometers : 90, averageTimeInMinutes : 90}]->(city2)

	MATCH (city1:City)
	WITH city1
	MATCH (city2:City)
	WHERE city1.name = "Mannheim" AND city2.name = "Ludwigshafen"
	CREATE (city1)-[relation:CONNECTED{distanceInKilometers : 2, averageTimeInMinutes : 15}]->(city2)
	
3) Search : 

	This operation is divided in 2 parts 
		1) Get list of nearby cities (Neo 4j)
		2) Get events with given genre and date in the list of nearby cities (Mongo DB)
	
	-	Querry in Neo will return list of nearby cities
	
			MATCH (city1{name: "Heidelberg"})-[r:CONNECTED]-(city2) 
			WHERE r.distanceInKilometers <= 45 
			RETURN city2.name
	
			-	Response : 
						"Mannheim"
						"Ludwigshafen"
			
	-	For each city run the following querry in mongo db 
		Then querry in mongo to get the detailed events details for genre and date / or get connected city and then querry in mongodb 
	
			db.events.find({ 
			$or: [{
			city:"Mannheim"
			},
			{
			city:"Ludwigshafen"
			}],
			genre:"science",
			$or: [{
			startDate:{$gte: ISODate("2019-05-19T00:00:00Z")},
			endDate:{$lte: ISODate("2019-05-19T23:59:00Z")}
			},
			{
			startDate:{$lte: ISODate("2019-05-19T00:00:00Z")},
			endDate:{$gte: ISODate("2019-05-19T23:59:00Z")}
			}]}).pretty()
